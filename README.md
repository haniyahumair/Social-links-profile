## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

Here's the edited version focusing on flexbox and margins:
markdown### What I learned

Working on this social links profile deepened my understanding of several key concepts:

**Flexbox Layout Control**: I gained a better understanding of how flexbox properties work together to create clean, centered layouts. Learning to use `flex-direction: column` with `align-items: center` was key to achieving the card design.

```css
main {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
}

section {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 20px;
}
 ```

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to focus on several areas to enhance my frontend development skills:

**Advanced CSS Animations**: While I've implemented basic hover effects and transforms, I want to dive deeper into complex keyframe animations, timing functions, and creating more sophisticated micro-interactions that can elevate user experience.

**CSS Transitions & Performance**: I'd like to explore more advanced transition techniques, including staggered animations, custom easing functions, and optimizing animations for better performance across different devices.

**Tailwind CSS Framework**: Having worked with vanilla CSS on this project, I'm eager to learn Tailwind CSS to speed up my development workflow. I want to understand how utility-first CSS can help me build responsive designs more efficiently while maintaining clean, maintainable code.

**JavaScript Integration**: I plan to incorporate more JavaScript functionality to create dynamic interactions, form validations, and state management for more complex user interfaces.

These areas will help me create more polished, professional web applications with smoother user experiences and faster development cycles.
